# TcNo-Acc-Switcher-Binaries
## Why is this here?
The [TcNo Account Switcher](https://github.com/TcNobo/TcNo-Acc-Switcher)  is an open-source project for switching accounts incredibly fast. It is free from viruses and made for the gaming/tech community to enjoy. While this was the complete intention of the program, VirusTotal and other AntiVirus software does sometimes pick up false positives. 

Upon submitting false positive reports they are removed and verified.

Sending hundreds of false positive reports is tedious, but it has to be done. This repo will serve as a place to publically serve these false positive binaries as a 'download server' for the files I need to submit. Makes sending lots of false positive reports easier as a download link doesn't trigger over-sensitive filter some inboxes have. The classic "This file could be a virus, it's a/contains an executable!!" -- Which makes no sense... Why would emails to a VIRUS CHECK/VERIFICATION INBOX BE BOUNCED FOR THIS REASON?
 
 Rant aside, there is nothing of interest here.
